# automated-image-downloader
This is a simple python script for downloading several images at once from google.  
It uses the tkinter library for generating a simple user interface, and lets the user type in a search and number of desired results, 
which then will be collected using web scraping with the Selenium webdriver, named in batch and added to a new folder in a location of your choosing.  

If you want to use this code yourself, there are a few things you'll need to rename, and paths that need to be updated,
but I have added comments in the code to hopefully make it pretty straight-forward.  

This was a hobby project intended to help me learn more about GUIs for Python, as well as web scraping. 
I imagine it could be a useful tool if you quickly want to generate training data for machine learning, etc, too.

Love to hear your thoughts on it, as well as how it could be improved.
